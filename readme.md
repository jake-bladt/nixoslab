# NixOS Lab

The purpose of this repository is to experiment with NixOS and the nix package manager. The questions I want to address are:

* Is it practical to use NixOS under Vagrant on Oracle Virtual Box?
* Can NixOS be used instead of Docker in normal DevOps workflows?
* Would using NixOS under Vagrant make a better workflow for my side projects than the current combination of Vagrant/Chef/Puppet/shell?
